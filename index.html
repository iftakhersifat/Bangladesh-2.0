            <p class="motivational-speech">"Each of us holds the power to create a world where poverty, inequality, and despair are relics of the past. Poverty is not the fault of the poor but a failure of systems we’ve built. Imagine what we could achieve if we redesigned these systems to empower everyone.Dream big, but remember: change begins with small, meaningful steps. When I started Grameen Bank, it was not a grand institution. It was an idea—a belief that even the smallest loan could transform lives. That belief has helped millions of people escape poverty. Your idea, no matter how small it seems, could change the world too.Focus on solutions, not problems. Every challenge is an opportunity in disguise. If you see hunger, envision a way to provide food. If you see inequality, imagine creating a space for fairness. Empower others, especially women. When you empower a woman, you change her family, her community, and ultimately the world. Finally, never doubt your potential. Each one of us has the capacity to do extraordinary things. Together, we can build a world of dignity, equality, and opportunity for all. Believe in yourself, and act today!" </p>
